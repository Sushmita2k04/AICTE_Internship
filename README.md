# ⚡ EV Adoption Forecasting – AICTE Internship Project

## 📌 About the Project

As part of my AICTE internship with Edunet Foundation, I worked on forecasting the future adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) using real-world vehicle registration data. With the rising popularity of EVs, I wanted to help address infrastructure planning challenges—especially around the need for more charging stations.

## 🧠 Problem I Tackled

The aim of my project was to build a **regression model** that predicts how many electric vehicles will be registered in future years. I used historical data, including EV types and county-wise registrations across Washington State, to uncover trends and make forecasts.

## 🎯 What I Set Out to Do

* Analyze historical EV growth from 2017 to 2024
* Understand regional differences in EV adoption
* Build and evaluate a machine learning model for forecasting future EV demand
* Visualize key trends and insights to support planning decisions

## 🗂️ Dataset I Used

* **Source**: [Kaggle – Electric Vehicle Population Size 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sahirmaharajj/electric-vehicle-population-size-2024/data)
* **Time Range**: January 2017 to February 2024
* **Region**: Counties in Washington State

### 🔑 Key Columns I Worked With:

* `Date`: Monthly registration snapshot
* `County`: Where the vehicles are registered
* `BEVs` & `PHEVs`: Counts of fully electric and hybrid vehicles
* `EV Total`: Combined total of BEVs and PHEVs
* `Total Vehicles` & `Percent EVs`: To analyze adoption rates

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies I Used

* **Python** (for data cleaning, analysis, and modeling)
* **Pandas & NumPy** (for data manipulation)
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for visualizations)
* **Scikit-learn** (for building regression models)
